# Conference Vision App

Conference Vision is a prototype reference app showcasing:
- Xamarin.Forms 3.0: 
  - [FlexLayout](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/flex-layout)
  - [CSS](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/styles/css) 
  - [VisualStateManager](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/visual-state-manager)
- [Custom Vision](https://customvision.ai)
- [Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)

Use your camera during a conference to capture your experience. Let Vision do the heavy lifting of identifying known products and scan your images to text for easier searching.
